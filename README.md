# Business-Analytics

In this program, you'll learn foundational data skills that apply across functions and industries. Learn data analysis skills and tools that will help you throughout your career, whether you’re in engineering, sales, marketing, operations, etc. Learn to use Excel, SQL and Tableau to manipulate, analyze and visualize data with the end goal of making better, data-informed decisions


# Why Business Analyics?

Business analytics is the process of using quantitative methods to derive meaning from data to make informed business decisions.

There are four primary methods of business analysis:

    Descriptive: The interpretation of historical data to identify trends and patterns
    Diagnostic: The interpretation of historical data to determine why something has happened
    Predictive: The use of statistics to forecast future outcomes
    Prescriptive: The application of testing and other techniques to determine which outcome will yield the best result in a given scenario

Deciding which method to employ is dependent on the business situation at hand.

## Overview

These projects show how to:

- Work with real-world data that has missing and incorrect values and answer questions using them
- Calculate key business metrics in financial analysis and interpret values
- Forecast financial metrics using scenario analysis
- Write SQL to query single and multiple tables
- Ask a question that requires data from multiple places, join the data together and answer those complex questions about the data in a database
- Evaluate the effectiveness of data visualization and select the most appropriate data visualization for analysis
- Build interactive and engaging Tableau dashboards

# Project 1: Analyze NYSE Data - Introduction to Data

In this project, we learn how to use statistics and visuals to find and communicate insights. We develop our Excel skills to manipulate,
analyze, and visualize data in a spreadsheet. Finally, we will build excel models to analyze possible business outcomes.

# Project 2: Query a Digital Music Store Database - SQL for Data Analysis. 

In this project, we will be provide a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. 
We’ll use statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report your conclusions and recommendations in a report. 
Queried a music store database using advanced SQL to answer specific business questions and used these insights to create a presentation. 

# Project 3: Data Visualization Project - Data Visualization with Tableau

Sharing insights is an integral part of working with data. 
In this project, we’ll build interactive dashboards with Tableau to tell stories from data. 
We’ll use a dataset of flight delays in the US to visualize the quality of airlines and airports, find the best times to fly, and more. 
These types of visualizations help guide decision making to reach the best outcomes.
We will implement the best design practices, and use the most appropriate chart for a particular situation.
