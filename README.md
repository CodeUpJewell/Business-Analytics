# Why Business Analyics?

Business analytics is the process of using quantitative methods to derive meaning from data to make informed business decisions.

There are four primary methods of business analysis:

    Descriptive: The interpretation of historical data to identify trends and patterns
    Diagnostic: The interpretation of historical data to determine why something has happened
    Predictive: The use of statistics to forecast future outcomes
    Prescriptive: The application of testing and other techniques to determine which outcome will yield the best result in a given scenario

Deciding which method to employ is dependent on the business situation at hand.

- SQL for Data Analysis
- Calculate metrics and create plots to visualize metrics in Excel 
- Data Visualization with Tableau
